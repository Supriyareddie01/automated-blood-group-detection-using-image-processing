# Blood-group-Detection-using-python
Project for detecting blood group using image processing in python:
The main objective is to blood cells contains red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell and platelet. The RBC carries oxygen from the lungs. The WBCs help to fight infection, and platelets are parts of CELL   that the body uses for clotting. All BLOOD CELL are produced in the bone marrow. in this we using deep learning technique to classify the cell and count the blood cell .if the person is infected in diseases like dungu,malaria cholera etc it will analysis the blood cells with the help of neural network technique.
IN this we using pre-processing, dwt, GLCM these are technique which we used and it is comes under image processing. Haemoglobin is an important protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of our body. In 
This we are using blob detection to classify the images.
